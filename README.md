# Newton Dynamics
Newton Dynamics is a cross-platform life-like physics simulation library. It can easily be integrated into game engines and other applications and provides top of it's class performance and simulation stability. Ongoing developement and a permissive license makes Newton Dynamics a top choice for all kinds of projects from scientific projects to game engines.

Newton Dynamics implements a deterministic solver, which is not based on traditional LCP or iterative methods, but possesses the stability and speed of both respectively. This feature makes Newton Dynamics a tool not only for games, but also for any real-time physics simulation.

Newton Physics engine is cross-platform by design and currently has offical ports for most operating systems Windows, Linux, MAC (including iPhone and iPod touch).
